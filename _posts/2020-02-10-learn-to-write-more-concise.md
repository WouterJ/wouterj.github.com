  <p class="external__description">Hemingway makes your writing bold and clear. It's like a
  spellchecker, but for style. It makes sure that your reader will focus
  on your message, not your prose.

  Too often, our words are like our thoughts — innumerable and
  disorganized. Almost any bit of writing could use some cutting. Less
  is more, etc.</p>

I almost always copy-paste my writings into the tool to check and
revisit some redundant parts and too long sentences. An average adult
reads around the 10th grade. All development language often doesn't have
a good influence on your grade, but at least you are aware of the
difficulty of your text.
